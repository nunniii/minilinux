Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

              Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free software license that guarantees
end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. Under
this license, software is free, but it also requires that any derivative work
be released under the same license. This is called "copyleft". The GPL was
written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

The general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software
for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GPL for most of
our software; it applies also to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (If a program is released under the GPL, that means you have the
freedom to copy, distribute, and modify it, subject to the conditions we
set forth in the license.)

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
     as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
     disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
     License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
     of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
     thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
     modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
     you also meet all of these conditions:
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     b) You must cause the whole work to be licensed at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
        (or else, saying that you provide the software under another, different
        warranty), and that users may redistribute it under these terms.

  3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
     as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt to do so is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
     parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
     will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

  4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
     it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
     the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law
     if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
     the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
     of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

  5. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
     the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
     to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
     You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
     the rights granted herein.

  6. If you distribute the Program or any derivative work, you must provide
     the complete corresponding source code, including any scripts used to
     control the compilation and installation of the executable. However, the
     source code need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
     either source or binary form) with the major components (such as compilers,
     window systems, and many libraries) of the operating system on which the
     Program is intended to run. For example, if the Program is a library
     that is intended to be linked with other libraries or applications to form
     executable programs, you do not have to distribute the source code of
     those other libraries or applications, but you must comply with the terms
     of this License for the Program.

  7. If you modify the Program, and distribute it, you must mark it in such a
     way that it is distinct from the original version, so that it is clear
     that the modified program is not the original one.

  8. The name of the Free Software Foundation or the name of any other
     organization, institution, or individual, should not be used to endorse
     or promote any program derived from this software without proper written
     permission.  

  9. This License does not grant you permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
     service marks, or product names of the Free Software Foundation, except as
     required for describing the origin of the Program and reproducing the content
     of the NOTICE file.

  10. If you do not want the conditions of this License to apply to your
      modifications, you can remove the GPL License from your modifications
      and relicense your code under a different license (such as a commercial license).

   11. **No warranty**. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
       ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
       WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
       SEE THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR THE FULL TEXT OF THE WARRANTY
       DISCLAIMER.

   12. **Termination**. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
       terminate automatically if you violate any of its terms. However, if
       you cure the violation within thirty days after becoming aware of it,
       your license may be reinstated.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
